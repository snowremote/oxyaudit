# Contributing

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions are licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

We use the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)**. Every commit must include a Signed-off-by line with your real name and email, for example:

```text
Signed-off-by: Andrew S. Louka <webmaster@snowremote.simplelogin.com>
```

Git can add this automatically with the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Brief, descriptive commit message"
```

If your Git identity isnâ€™t configured yet:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

Pull requests without a valid DCO sign-off will not be accepted.
